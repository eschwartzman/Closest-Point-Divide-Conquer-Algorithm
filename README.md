This is an implementation of a shortest points problem written in Java. The goal is, given a large set of point, to find which are closest.

The implementation includes a naive solution as well as a divide and conquer algorithm. Both give the same answer, but the divide and conquer solution is much faster.

Output.txt and SomeResults.txt have some example solutions
